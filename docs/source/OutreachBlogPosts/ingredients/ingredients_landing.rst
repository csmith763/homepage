Optimization Key ingredients
============================

In this next set of posts, we will discuss three of the most essential topics related to optimization: :boldblue:`objective functions`, :boldblue:`constraints`, and how to :boldblue:`formulate and optimization problem`. Correctly defining the objective and constraints that affect the problem of interest is critical to identifying the best solution. There are also different types of constraints, equality and inequality, both of which may be applicable for an optimization problem. By the end of this section, you will gain an understanding about the core principles that are required to set up your own optimization problem!
